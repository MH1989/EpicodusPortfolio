      <h3>Why Epicodus</h3>
        <p>
          In 2013, I worked as a full-life cycle recruiter specializing in IT. During my time in this industry, I grew my knowledge about computer programming simply through my pursuit to seek candidates and place them in softare development roles. In order to do my job well, it required that I do research on what companies sought in candidates from a technology standpoint. Eventually, I started to get increasingly fascinated but what one was able to accomplish through acquiring these techincal skills. When I moved back to Portland in January of 2015, I came across the Code Oregon / Treehouse partnership and immediately signed-up. As time went on, I realized my method of one hour of coding per day was inconsistent as it was difficult to keep myself accountable. Soon enough, I found out about Epicodus while doing research on local bootcamps and was immediately sold. I signed up in less than a week after finding out and then was accepted nearly half that time after I applied.
